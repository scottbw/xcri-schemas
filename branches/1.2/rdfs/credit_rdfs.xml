  <rdfs:comment>Instances of this class may be used to represent either an account of the credits that 
  can be obtained from completion of a learning opportunity, or of the credits obtained as a result of 
  completing a learning opportunity, depending on the context in which an instance occurs. In each case,
   a separate Credit instance must be used to represent credit within a particular scheme.</rdfs:comment>

<rdf:Property rdf:about="http://purl.org/net/cm/scheme">
	<rdfs:label>Scheme</rdfs:label>
    <rdfs:comment>The scheme under which credits are obtained.
    
    The scheme should be identified using a URI conforming to [IETF-RFC2396]. The value of this property may 
    dereference to a resource describing the scheme. Note that the scheme defines the context in which the 
    level and value of the credit should be interpreted.

<rdf:Property rdf:about="http://purl.org/net/cm/level">
	<rdfs:label>Level</rdfs:label>
    <rdfs:comment>The level at which credits are obtained.
    
    Level should be interpreted in the context of the scheme of the credit resource to which the level pertains. 
    Level may contain any literal value, however implementations should consider the use of URIs to represent 
    levels unambiguously, particularly where more than one type of level can be associated with a particular credit 
    scheme.

	Note 1 Attention is also drawn to [DCMI-Terms] educationLevel as a similar, but not semantically equivalent, term.

	Note 2 Not all credit schemes may recognise or use a concept of level for credits.

<rdf:Property rdf:about="http://purl.org/net/cm/value">
	<rdfs:label>Value</rdfs:label>
    <rdfs:comment>The number of credits that have been obtained or can be obtained.
    
    Value should be interpreted in the context of the scheme of the credit resource to which the value pertains. 
    Values may typically, though not exclusively, be represented as unsigned integer values; this is dependent 
    on the scheme of the credit resource.
